# Data Tidying
# Assignment 2

Render a box-plot with the data contained in the data1.csv file, showing also one point for each value of the data (use horizontal jitter).

Plot automatically a data table by selecting the data from the files data1.csv, data2.csv and data3.csv (Use an html <select> tag and the onchange event).
  
Render a bar-chart with the data contained in one column of data2.csv by allowing the user to select a column with a mouse-click of it.

Make a multiple box-plot for each column of the file data3.csv (that is, use only one y-axis and place them in an x-axis of type d3.scaleBand()).
